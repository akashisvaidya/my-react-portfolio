              I am a full-stack software engineer who loves coding,
              problem-solving, and learning about new topics. <br></br>I love
              discussing ideas, talking to other people, and getting to know
              their perspectives and thoughts on various topics, <br></br>{" "}
              whether it be coding, data structure, algorithms, VS-code
              shortcuts, the universe, poetry, life, the arts, philosophy, etc.
              <br></br> If I am not coding or listening to a podcast, I am
              watching a comedy special, reading a book, or annoying my
              beautiful wife. <br></br>
              You are welcome to get in touch with me to discuss your web
              development needs or to share some jokes; I won't mind either. See
              ya. üòÅ .
